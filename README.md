# What exactly is a chatbot?

A chatbot is an artificial intelligence (AI) software that can simulate a conversation (or a chat) with a user in natural language through messaging applications, websites, mobile apps or through the telephone.
Why are chatbots important? A chatbot is often described as one of the most advanced and promising expressions of interaction between humans and machines. However, from a technological point of view, a chatbot only represents the natural evolution of a Question Answering system leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP). Formulating responses to questions in natural language is one of the most typical Examples of Natural Language Processing applied in various enterprisesâ€™ end-use applications.

# Problem Statement

Human language is astoundingly complex and diverse. When we write, we often misspell or abbreviate words, or omit punctuation. There is a lot of unstructured data around us. Natural language processing helps computers communicate with humans in their own language and scales other language-related tasks. NLP makes it possible for computers to read text, interpret it, measure sentiment and determine which parts are important.

Understanding this will enable us to build the core component of any conversational chatbot. In this NLP application we will create the core engine of a chat bot. We will learn text classification using the techniques of natural language processing by using the nltk library.
